    Hello, Clark here, this is a Bot made for Discord with the Discord.py library. With the intentions of
getting Vainglory statics from within Discord. Project will have some documentation in the code, but other
then that you should look at the Discord.py API Documentation directly for more information on how the bot works,
http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. This bot connects to the Vainglory api by python this is made possible
thanks to the python gamelocker wrapper, python - gamelocker. Again some of the Vainglory api code will be commented but
you should really be learning from the Vainglory API docs, https://developer.vainglorygame.com/docs.
