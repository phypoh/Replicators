WIP Wishlist:
    Imagine a AI/Siri sort off assistant that could be used to not only work for notifying u and stuff but also for the app we will make
    For example, @EZLBot send my next opponent my teams available times to set up our next match
    The entire welcome process
    could be a paid feature once perfected
    Furthermore, imagine the bot being able to notify u of all upcoming events on calendar and auto notify u
    Imagine having the ability to music in more than one channel like i explained
    Imagine having the bot do stuff like what u explained with helping your game
    this could be a paid feature
    the free features u can basically take everything other open source do and improve on them
    furthermore, you can have the bot be available in multiple languages so each language costs a little after the first default language
    then u have the ability to filter the music do a certain age requiremetns or language requirement
    i can go on and on about the paid features
    Its ability to be used not only on discord but other platforms
    recording voice
    and making commands using voice
    like telling it what song to play with ur voice
    instead of having a voice channel
    @BoWhackEm lol tell me when its enough
    u make it so that the user can have it set to research and collect API data for their next opponent
    and display it
    etc
    checks every hour to refresh and puts more data on opponent
    ability to customize which data u want and dont want
    I will have this all written on the google doc when i get a chance
    I have a lot of ideas in my head for it
